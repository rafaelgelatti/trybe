--- Rafael Gelatti's Repository ---

This is where I save my exercises, projects and learnings from the Software Developer course at Trybe.

I am still getting the hang of it, and organizing it.

It's a never ending process.

--- MAIN ---

There are directories separated by #id, and each one of them contains a README.md file that explains their content.

"We are the music makers<br>
And we are the dreamers of the dreams<br>
Wandering by lone sea breakers<br>
And sitting by desolate streams<br>
World losers and world forsakers<br>
On whom the pale moon gleams<br>
Yet we are the movers and the shakers<br>
Of the world forever it seems"<br>
