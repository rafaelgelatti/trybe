<h3>JavaScript 5-3 Events</h3>

---

<strong>exercises1.html</strong> is self-explanatory

<strong>exercises2.html</strong> is self-explanatory

<strong>exercises3.html</strong> is self-explanatory

<strong>exercises4.html</strong> is self-explanatory

<strong>exercises5.html</strong> In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them,<br>
and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")

<strong>exercises6.html</strong> Add a script tag, and add the functions from the calculator exercise (view the solution if you haven't done it yet).<br>
For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result<br>
of the calculation in the solution div.<br>
Bonus: respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button.

<strong>exercises7.html</strong> is self-explanatory

<strong>exercises8.html</strong> Add a script tag at the bottom of the page, where you'll put all your code.<br>
Create a variable to store a reference to the img.<br>
Change the style of the img to have a "left" of "0px", so that it starts at the left hand of the screens.<br>
Create a function called catWalk() that moves the cat 10 pixels to the right of where it started, by changing the "left" style property.<br>
Call that function every 50 milliseconds. Your cat should now be moving across the screen from left to right. Hurrah!<br>
<em>TO-DO</em> <strong>Bonus #1:</strong> When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, restart them at the left hand side ("0px").<br>
So they should keep walking from left to right across the screen, forever and ever.<br>
<strong>Bonus #2:</strong> When the cat reaches the right-hand of the screen, make them move backwards instead.<br>
They should keep walking back and forth forever and ever.<br>
<strong>Bonus #3:</strong> When the cat reaches the middle of the screen, replace the img with an image of a cat dancing, keep it dancing for 10 seconds,<br>
and then replace the img with the original image and have it continue the walk.

<strong>exercicises9.html</strong> Seu trabalho é adicionar o evento correto a cada um dos três elementos button da página e um evento ao elemento input,<br>
de forma que a função mais apropriada definida no JavaScript seja acionada quando quem usa interagir com cada elemento, clicando ou digitando, por exemplo.
