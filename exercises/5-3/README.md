<strong>exercises5.html</strong> In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them,<br>
and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")

<strong>exercises6.html</strong> Add a script tag, and add the functions from the calculator exercise (view the solution if you haven't done it yet).<br>
For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result<br>
of the calculation in the solution div.<br>
Bonus: respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button.
